First get the reference interpreter running. Then get the skeleton running. You'll also want to test the grading script (project-grading/grade.sh).

If you encounter problems running a script, run it with "bash -x ./script.sh" to see debugging output; to get help, post the full trace to Piazza along with other information about your OS and environment.

Before running the skeleton, you need to build it. Before building it, you need to download and extract CUP and JFlex and export the needed environment variables. See quandary-skeleton/README (and read the Makefile if needed) for more info.

You may need a newer version of the JDK. Folks have reported needing a JDK version of 11 or 12 or later.

If you're on stdlinux, you need to do the following (just once): run "subscribe JDK-CURRENT" then log out and back in.

Linux is recommended, but many people have used had success on macOS, or even on Windows by using Ubuntu for Windows or Cygwin.

In order for the grade.sh script to work on macOS, you may need to install the correct variant of the realpath command using the following command:

  brew install coreutils

On "Ubuntu for Windows" you mean need to run

  sed -i 's/\r$//' quandary

on the quandary scripts to fiux errors about trailing '\r' characters.
