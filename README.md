`quandary.pdf` describes the Quandary language and runtime specification.

The `quandary-ref` folder contains a pre-built, obfuscated Quandary reference interpreter. Execute `quandary-ref/quandary` to run the interpreter.

The `quandary-skeleton` folder contains source code for an interpreter with missing functionality (search for "TODO"). See `quandary-skeleton/README` for build and run info.

The `quandary-examples` folder contains Quandary code examples.

The `project-grading` folder contains the grading template.

#### GETTING STARTED

See `TROUBLESHOOTING` if you have trouble getting the Quandary reference interpreter or skeleton interpreter running.

You should read `quandary.pdf` before attempting the assignments.
