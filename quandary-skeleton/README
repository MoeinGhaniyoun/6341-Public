BUILDING AND RUNNING

To get started, set two environment variables to your locations of JFlex and CUP:

  export JFLEX_DIR=$HOME/jflex-1.7.0
  export CUP_DIR=$HOME/cup

I'm using JFlex 1.7.0 (https://jflex.de/release/jflex-1.7.0.tar.gz) and
CUP 0.11b-20160615 (http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/releases/java-cup-bin-11b-20160615.tar.gz).

To build the lexer, parser, and interpreter:

  make

To run the interpreter:

  ./quandary [OPTIONS] QUANDARY_PROGRAM INTEGER_ARG_TO_MAIN

Run without any arguments to see supported options.

SKELETON DESCRIPTION

The skeleton provides a lot of Quandary functionality,
but several things are missing or (intentionally) don't work correctly.
You can search for "TODO" in the source code to find the missing and incorrect stuff. Here's a summary:

- The lexer and parser don't support [ expr1 OP expr2 ] syntax. <-- 1st project
- Local variables aren't handled correctly: every variable is treated like a global variable. <-- 1st project
- It's missing support for static type checking. <-- 2nd project
- It's missing support for garbage collection (automatic memory management) and explicit memory management. <-- 3rd project
- It's missing support for concurrency. <-- 4th project

Project assignments and descriptions are on Carmen.

If you have any questions or problems with the skeleton or the reference implementation,
make a public Piazza post. You're probably not the only person with the same question or issue,
and you may have found a ($10) bug.

When working on your interpreter this semester, make sure that you don't make your modified interpreter
a public project on GitHub (or publicly available in any other way).
That's a violation of academic integrity. And of course don't share or show your interpreter source code to anyone either.
If you want to use GitHub to make a private project, note that (as a student) you can get a free upgrade to a GitHub account
that allows private projects: https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new

SUBMITTING A PROJECT

You can use the following command to prepare a submission for upload to Carmen,
where MY_PROJECT_DIR is the location of your project (the directory containing the quandary script and Makefile):

  tar --exclude='.git*' -cf - -C MY_PROJECT_DIR . | gzip > myproject.tgz

That command creates myproject.tgz in the current directory.
